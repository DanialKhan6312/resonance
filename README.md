"Dripify will drip you with the drippiest drip"

Dripify is a photo editing application that adds a better outfit to improve your profile picture. Our application uses 
a face detection algorithm and coordinate based positioning system to accomplish this. We believe that during these 
times,  many have begun to lose their sense of fashion and what it is truly like to have “drip”. Dripify is the simple 
and obvious solution to this. Consider updating your professional profiles with this new and improved image of yourself 
to guarantee that your new “dripped out” image stands out from others.
